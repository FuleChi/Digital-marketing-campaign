### Introduction

Every leader would agree that their greatest challenge is to design policies that satisfies everybody. 

This is no different than the Parliament of India, who in September 2020 passed three farm acts that led to a farmer's protest. 

During the pre-internet era, such a situation would be easily brought under control by meeting farmer's unions and leaders in the affected communities.

However, during the internet era, the situation easily spreads like wild fire, making it difficult to manaage by authorities. 

Without a clue about whose opinion is actually fuelling the uproar, it is difficult and even close to impossible for policy makers to control the situation since chances of having an effective dialogue are low.

Fortunately, with the right analysis of the data collected from Twitter (X) , it is possible to initiate the dialogues with the right audience.



### About the Data

The data presents a 2020â€“2021 Indian farmers' protest by Farmer unions and their representatives, who  have demanded that the laws be repealed and have stated that they will not accept a compromise. 

In the light of this protest, social media users have been very active in voicing their opinion about the matter. 

The hashtag "#FarmersProtest" is very prevalent on Twitter, with thousands of users tweeting thousands of tweets with the hashtag.

The dataset consists of a JSON file, containing raw data about the tweets that have the hashtag "#FarmersProtest" (tweeted since February 1, 2021).
