Introduction

Every leader would agree that the greatest challenge is to design policies that satisfies everybody.

The 2020â€“2021 Indian farmers' protest is an ongoing protest against three farm acts which were passed by the Parliament of India in September 2020. Farmer unions and their representatives have demanded that the laws be repealed and have stated that they will not accept a compromise.

In the light of this protest, social media users have been very active in voicing their opinion about the matter. "#FarmersProtest" is very prevalent on Twitter, with thousands of users tweeting thousands of tweets with the hashtag.

How can policy makers use the infromations on social media platforms to inform their decision-making process?

About the Data

The dataset will be updated on a weekly basis (every Tuesday) for new tweets. The dataset is suffixed with version number as follows: 2021-monthNumber-weekNumber. For example, the file for the dataset version updated in the 2nd week of March will be suffixed with 2021-03-2.
